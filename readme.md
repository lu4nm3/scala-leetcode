# Scala LeetCode

This repo contains problems from LeetCode with solutions written in Scala 

## Motivation

One criticism that is often given of Scala is that it is a language that is very complex and hard to reason about. By
using Scala to solve several LeetCode questions, this project will serve as an example of how Scala can actually be used
in a very practical and quite elegant manner. Perhaps, it might encourage you to give it a try next time you're looking
for a powerful, type-safe language that scales with your needs. 

## Table of Contents

Each problem provides a solution in both Markdown for easy viewing and as an application object which allows you to 
execute the code your favorite Scala environment. In addition, the `utils` module provides additional helper classes 
that are used throughout different problems.
